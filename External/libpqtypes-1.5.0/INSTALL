LIBPQTYPES INSTALLTION GUIDE
----------------------------

*) UNIX BUILDS

For quick builds, run the below:

  ]# ./configure
  ]# make
  ]# make install

  (Also `make uninstall', which removes all installed headers,
   libs and mans pages)

By default, only a shared library is built.  To build a static
library, use the `--enable-static' option.

To build a thread-safe version, use the `--enable-thread-safety' option.
To use libpqtypes in a thread-safe environment, the system must have
pthreads installed.  Most systems will have /usr/include/pthread.h
and /usr/lib/libpthread.so or /usr/lib/libthread.so.

The default prefix is `/usr/local', so if the `--prefix' option is
not specified the header file(s) will be installed at
/usr/local/include and the library file(s) will be installed at
/usr/local/lib.

If your system doesn't include a `long long' data type, resulting in
a library compile error, you can specify an alternative by setting
PQT_LONG_LONG=data_type during configure.

  ]# CFLAGS="-DPQT_LONG_LONG=my_int8" ./configure

Files installed:

  - $(prefix)/include/libpqtypes.h
  - $(prefix)/lib/libpqtypes.so

When `--enable-static' is specified:

  - $(prefix)/lib/libpqtypes.a

To dynamically link with libpqtypes, pass -lpqtypes to the linker.



*) MINGW AND CYGWIN BUILDS

There is no configure for MinGW or Cygwin.  Execute the below from
the root of the source tar ball within the cygwin shell or msys.

  ]# make -f Makefile.win32 [options] [targets]



*) MSVC BUILDS

MSVC versions 6, 7 and 8 have all been tested.  Versions prior to 6
may work but are not supported.

The MSVC build uses `nmake' and can be executed from the root of the
source tar ball at a DOS prompt:

  > nmake -f win32.mak [options] [targets]



*) MINGW, CYGWIN & MSVC BUILDS:

For the below examples, MAKE is defined as:

  # MSVC
  MAKE = nmake -f win32.mak

  # CYGWIN & MINGW
  MAKE = make -f Makefile.win32

Targets:

  all       - build the libpqtypes library
  test      - build the libpqtypes regression test
  clean     - delete all files generated by compiles
  install   - Install the binaries, headers and man3 pages
  uninstall - Uninstalls libpqtypes, reverse of install target

Thread-safe:

  $(MAKE) MT=1

  NOTE: MinGW and/or Cygwin may require installing pthreads.

Specify alternative 64-bit int data type:

  $(MAKE) PQT_LONG_LONG=my_int8

Global make & nmake compiler/linker variables:

	CC     = C compiler
	INC    = includes
	CFLAGS = compiler flags
	LPATH  = library path.  MINGW and CYGWIN use -L while MSVC can supply a single path

	# If libpq is not installed and you use MSVC, try this (replace paths):
	> $(MAKE) INC="-Ic:\pgsql\src\interfaces\libpq" LPATH="-Ic:\pgsql\src\interfaces\libpq\Release"

Files generated:

  libpqtypes.dll    - Windows DLL
  libpqtypesdll.lib - Import lib for DLL
  libpqtypes.lib    - Static library

Where to install files:

  - System Include Path: libpqtypes.h
  - System Library Path: libpqtypes.dll
  - System Library Path: libpqtypesdll.lib
  - System Library Path: libpqtypes.lib (static lib)
