LIBPQTYPES LIBRARY
------------------

This package contains the source code, documentation and management
files for the libpqtypes library, an extension to the PostgreSQL
libpq library.

libpqtypes is a libpq extension that offers a new way of handling 
parameterized queries and getting result field values.  Both 
putting parameters and getting values use a printf/scanf style 
interface, with consistent specifiers for both. 

  - Full support for binary and text format (parameter and result)

  - Full support for composites, arrays and composite arrays.

  - printf style interface to libpq's binary parameterized API.

  - scanf style interface for getting values: PQgetvalue extension.

  - Ability to register user-defined types, aliases and data type
    sub-classes for use with printf style interfaces: ex. "%mytype".

  - Per-thread global error message: PQgeterror, PQseterror.

  - Online docs as well as man pages.
