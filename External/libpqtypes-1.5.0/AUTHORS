Original people behind the libpqtypes project core functionality and
architecture (June 2007 - Apr 2008).  The wounded warriors who battled the
PostgreSQL team trying to get libpqtypes into the main source tree.  That
battle continues to be waged as we believe libpqtypes is a far more
advanced and powerful client interface for PostgreSQL than the vanilla libpq.
